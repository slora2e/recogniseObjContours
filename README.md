# Convert "dynamic" type to EmguCV image
I have Python code to recognize object contours. I call a code from C# using by "pythonnet" nuget-packet. Pythonnet uses "dynamic" type to call a functions from Python. I need help with convert dynamic type to image or any other way. Finally i want to take recognised image from Python and use in C#. Image from Python should store only in memory. (Exists easiest way: save python image and use path, but it's not a solution...)
